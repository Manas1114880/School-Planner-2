    The idea:
    Asks for amount of free time.
    Asks for assignments and he amount of time it takes
    Makes a schedule

    If more time:
    - Make it look fancy
    - Add priority to list
    - Saves it onto a ledger so it can update if they come later (this is only if we have A LOT of time)
